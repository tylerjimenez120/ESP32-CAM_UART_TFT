📡 High-Speed Serial Video Streaming with ESP32

This project demonstrates a real-time wired video streaming system built on a dual ESP32 architecture. An ESP32-CAM captures and compresses images, which are transmitted over a high-speed UART link (2 Mbps) to a second ESP32 driving an ILI9488 TFT display.

The focus of this project is not on raw hardware power, but on efficient system design: custom serial protocols, tight memory management without PSRAM, and low-level driver integration using ESP-IDF and native C. It proves that with a carefully engineered architecture, constrained embedded hardware can be pushed to its practical limits.
